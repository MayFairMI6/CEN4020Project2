# CEN4020 Project 2
# Bellini College Class Scheduling System

A web-based scheduling system for the Bellini College class scheduling committee. The system consumes class data from Excel spreadsheets across multiple semesters and provides tools to view, manage, audit, and export the college's class schedule.

## Features

### Implemented User Stories

1. **Excel File Upload & Import** — Upload Excel files and automatically import class data into the system, populating the scheduling database without manual data entry.

2. **Search & Filter** — Search and filter classes by course code, instructor, semester, or department to quickly locate specific classes.

3. **Room Weekly Timetable** — View the weekly timetable of a specific classroom in a time-slot grid layout, showing room utilization and available time slots at a glance.

4. **Instructor Weekly Schedule** — View the weekly teaching schedule of an instructor with automatic conflict detection, highlighting overlapping class times.

5. **Room & Time Slot Suggestions** — Suggest available rooms and time slots when scheduling a new class, filtering by minimum duration.

6. **Semester Comparison** — Compare schedules across different semesters to analyze course offerings, enrollment changes, and course availability.

7. **Classroom Utilization Statistics** — Visualize classroom utilization statistics such as percentage of time rooms are occupied, integrated into the room timetable view.

8. **Schedule Export** — Export the finalized class schedule to downloadable Excel or CSV format.

9. **Schedule Audit Report** — Generate a comprehensive audit report that scans for duplicate CRNs, instructor time conflicts, room time conflicts, unreasonable meeting times, and missing data. Color-coded by severity with expandable categories.

10. **Detailed Class View** — Open a detailed view for any class section showing all scheduling information in one place: course data, schedule, instructor, enrollment, TAs, and related sections. Accessible via clickable CRN links throughout the app.

### Data

The system processes three Excel files containing Bellini College class schedules:

- `Bellini Classes S25.xlsx` — Spring 2025 (118 classes)
- `Bellini Classes F25.xlsx` — Fall 2025 (153 classes)
- `Bellini Classes S26.xlsx` — Spring 2026 (147 classes)

A data normalization layer handles inconsistent column naming across the files (e.g., `MEETING_DAYS` vs `MEETING DAYS`, `MEETING TIMES1` vs `MEETING TIMES`) and standardizes them into a unified schema.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3, Flask
- **Data Processing**: pandas, openpyxl
- **Database**: Normalized CSV (`data/schedule_database.csv`)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (server-side rendered via Jinja2 templates)

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Application

```bash
python3 main.py
```

The server starts at **http://127.0.0.1:5001**.

### Populating the Database

The schedule database (`data/schedule_database.csv`) comes pre-populated with all three semester files. To reimport, use the upload feature on the home page or run:

```bash
python3 -c "
from app.data_service import normalize_dataframe, DATA_FILE
import pandas as pd, os

files = ['uploads/Bellini Classes S25.xlsx', 'uploads/Bellini Classes F25.xlsx', 'uploads/Bellini Classes S26.xlsx']
dfs = [normalize_dataframe(pd.read_excel(f)) for f in files]
combined = pd.concat(dfs, ignore_index=True).drop_duplicates(subset=['CRN', 'TERM'], keep='last')
os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(DATA_FILE), exist_ok=True)
combined.to_csv(DATA_FILE, index=False)
print(f'Imported {len(combined)} classes')
"
```
